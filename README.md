# CoreGenome
Only map to the genome region that we need, so as to map faster and more accurate!

**Ampl\_to\_Gene\_region.R** Transform amplicon bed file into gene bed file if you want to use.  
**MkCoreGenome.py** Make core reference genome from raw reference genome.  
**MapCoreGenome.py** Map fastq to core reference genome, result is a sam file.

Ex: CoreGenome.sh

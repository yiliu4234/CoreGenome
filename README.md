# CoreGenome
Only map to the genome region that we need, so as to map faster and more accurate!

**Ampl\_to\_Gene\_region.R** Transform amplicon bed file into gene bed file if you want to use.</br>
**MkCoreGenome.py** Make core reference genome from raw reference genome. Â </br>
**MapCoreGenome.py** Map core reference genome sam file to raw reference genome sam file, its result is a sam file.</br>

Ex: CoreGenome.sh
